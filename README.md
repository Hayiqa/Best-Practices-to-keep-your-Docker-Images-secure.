# Best-Practices-to-keep-your-Docker-Images-secure.
Docker has revolutionized the way developers package and deploy applications. It has made life so simple and easy for developers. But what is docker?

Let’s start with the definition.

Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software in such a way that when you download it on your computer you just need to run the container and the environment will be automatically set for you. No need to go through the trouble of downloading different libraries, tools, and packages to run someone else application.

To understand this article, you need to know what is a Docker image

A docker image is made when we run the docker file using the command docker-compose up. A Docker image acts as a set of instructions to build a docker container. A docker image consists of different layers, each one originates from the previous layer but is different from it. These layers speed up the reusability and decrease the disk used when the build is run again.


However, with the increasing popularity of containerized applications, container security has become a significant concern. Docker images are the building blocks of containerized applications, and keeping them secure is critical.

Some best practices to keep your docker image secure are the following:

1. Use the official Image

An official image has clear documentation, promotes best practices, and is designed for the most common use cases. Docker Hub has a collection of official images that are regularly updated and maintained by docker. It is a secure and reliable way. Docker also provides ways to verify the integrity of official images.

2. Keep your images up-to-date

You don’t need to daily update your images which can lead to vulnerabilities and bug fixes. You can use Docker Compose and Docker Swarm to automate the update process.

3. Use Minimal Images

Minimal images only contain necessary components that are needed to run your application which also reduces the loss if any attack happens.

4. Limit the Number of Layers

When an image is made it consists of different layers. The more layers are, the more complex it will get. It is best practice to reduce the image size by limiting the number of layers. This will keep them safe and secure and will also reduce the attack surface.

5. Minimize the risk of Vulnerabilities

Only include the necessary packages for your Docker image. This minimizes the risk of vulnerabilities as different libraries and packages contain many vulnerabilities. The more vulnerabilities in your image, the greater the risk of losing data when an attack has been made. You can use synk to find vulnerabilities in your Docker image.


6. Secure Docker Host

The most important part is that your docker host must be secured. It should be updated regularly with the latest security patches and any unnecessary service must be disabled. You should use a strong password and should limit access to only authorized users.

7. Docker Security Scanning

Docker Security Scanning is a service provided by Docker that automatically scans your Docker images for known vulnerabilities. Using Docker Security Scanning is a good practice because it provides an extra layer of security and helps you identify and fix vulnerabilities in your Docker images.

8. Use Image Signing

Image Signing ensures that the docker image that you are running is the one you intended to run and has not been tampered with by anyone. It is a good practice to use Image signing as it verifies the integrity of your docker images by using digital signatures.

In conclusion, it is very important to secure your Docker images and ensure the security of containerized applications. Many applications are made and deployed on the container, so it is the responsibility of every person working on docker to secure the images and not do anything that will bring vulnerabilities to the image.
